# Tip-Calculator
---
In this project, I will be creating a tip calculator for the famous, Michelin Star-Winning, "Toney's Steakhouse". After entering your bill amount and tip percentage, this calculator will calculate the tip(in dollars) that a customer would like to leave nad the bill total. After this has been calculated, the user will them have the option to split the bill based on the amount of people in their party. Once the user has received all of the information that they've requested, the calculator will prompt if the user would like to calculate another bill or quit the application.
